<p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for the detection and diagnosis of diseases. MRI scanners sequentially collect measurements in the frequency domain (or k-space), from which an image is reconstructed. A central challenge in MRI is its time-consuming sequential acquisition process as the scanner needs to densely sample the underlying k-space for accurate reconstruction. In order to improve patients’ comfort & safety and alleviate motion artifacts, reconstructing high-quality images from limited measurements is desirable. There are two core parts in the accelerated MRI pipeline: a sampling pattern deployed to collect the undersampled data in k-space and a corresponding reconstruction method (reconstructor) that also enables recovering any missing information. In this work, we use machine-learned models to predict the undersampling pattern and perform image reconstruction in a single pass and in an object-adaptive manner.</p>

<p>In many scientific applications arising in material science, shock physics, inertial confinement fusion, and in nuclear security applications, such as stockpile stewardship, a sequence of radiographic images are acquired and used in an attempt to elucidate the physics models and their associated parameters. Object density reconstruction from these projections containing scattered radiation and noise is of critical importance in many applications. However, density reconstructions performed using forward modeling approaches from experimental radiographic data of dynamic tests are complicated by the noisy and complex multiscale & multiphysics environment. In other words, scatter limits the ability to perform accurate reconstructions. </p>

<p>Incorporating machine-learning models could prove beneficial for accurate density reconstruction, particularly in dynamic imaging, where the time evolution of the density fields could be captured by partial differential equations (PDE) or by learning from hydrodynamics simulations. For example, in one work we show that a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) can be learned using a 3D-UNet in order to denoise the corrupted densities in accordance with known physics principles. In this work, we demonstrate the ability of learned deep neural networks to perform artifact removal in noisy density reconstructions, where the noise is imperfectly characterized. This method outperforms the baseline and densities descattered by this framework closely match the ground truth over time. </p>

<p>All in all, we train the networks from large-density time-series datasets, with noise simulated according to parametric random distributions that may mimic noise in experiments.</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">Abstract</h3>

<p>Reconstruction of CT images from a limited set of projections through an object is important in several applications ranging from medical imaging to industrial settings.
As the number of available projections decreases, traditional reconstruction techniques such as the Feldkamp, Davis, and Kress (FDK) algorithm and model based iterative reconstruction methods perform poorly. </p>

<p>This work focuses on image reconstruction in such settings, namely, when both the number of available CT projections and the training data is extremely
limited. We adopt a sequential reconstruction approach over several stages using an adversarially trained shallow network for "destreaking" followed by a data-consistency update in each
stage. We use image subvolumes to train our method and patch aggregation and a hybrid 3D-to-2D mapping network for the "destreaking" component. Comparisons
to other methods over several test examples indicate that the proposed method has much potential when both the number of projections and available training data are highly limited.</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">Abstract</h3>

<p>This work examines optimized parallel combinations of deep networks and conventional regularized reconstruction for improved quality of MR image reconstructions from undersampled k-space data. Features learned by deep networks and typical model-based iterative algorithms (e.g., sparsity-penalized reconstruction) could complement each other for effective reconstructions. We observe that combining the image features from multiple approaches in a parallel fashion with appropriate learned weights leads to more effective image representations that are not captured by either strictly supervised or (unsupervised) conventional iterative methods. </p>

<h3 class="section-heading"><div align=center>Adaptive Local Neighborhood-based Neural Networks for MR Image Reconstruction from Undersampled Data</div></h3>

<p>Recent medical image reconstruction techniques focus on generating high-quality medical images
    suitable for clinical use at the lowest possible cost and
    with the fewest possible adverse effects on patients. Recent
    works have shown significant promise for reconstructing
    MR images from sparsely sampled k-space data using deep
    learning. In this work, we propose a technique that rapidly
    estimates deep neural networks directly at reconstruction
    time by fitting them on small adaptively estimated neighborhoods of a training set. In brief, our algorithm alternates
    between searching for neighbors in a data set that are similar to the test reconstruction, and training a local network
    on these neighbors followed by updating the test reconstruction. Because our reconstruction model is learned on
    a dataset that is structurally similar to the image being reconstructed rather than being fit on a large, diverse training
    set, it is more adaptive to new scans. It can also handle
    changes in training sets and flexible scan settings, while
    being relatively fast. Our approach, dubbed LONDN-MRI,
    was validated on the FastMRI multi-coil knee data set using
    deep unrolled reconstruction networks. Reconstructions
    were performed at four fold and eight fold undersampling
    of k-space with 1D variable-density random phase-encode
    undersampling masks. Our results demonstrate that our
    proposed locally-trained method produces higher-quality
    reconstructions compared to models trained globally on
    larger datasets.</p>

<p>We present a method for supervised learning of sparsity-promoting regularizers, which are a key ingredient in many modern signal reconstruction approaches. The parameters of the regularizer are learned to minimize the mean squared error of reconstruction on a training set of ground truth signal and measurement pairs. Training involves solving a challenging bilevel optimization problem with a nonsmooth lower-level objective.</p>

<p>We derive an expression for the gradient of the training loss using the implicit closed-form solution of the lower-level variational problem given by its dual problem, and provide an accompanying gradient descent algorithm (dubbed BLORC) to minimize the loss. Our experiments on simple natural images and for denoising 1D signals show that the proposed method can learn meaningful operators and the analytical gradients are calculated faster than standard automatic differentiation methods. While the approach we present is applied to denoising, we believe that it could be adapted to a wide variety of inverse problems with linear measurement models, thus giving it applicability in a wide range of scenarios.</p>

<p>In this work, we study the deep image prior (DIP) for reconstruction problems in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). DIP has become a popular approach for image reconstruction, where it recovers the clear image by fitting an overparameterized convolutional neural network (CNN) to the corrupted/undersampled measurements.  
    To improve the performance of DIP, recent work shows that using a reference image as an input often leads to improved reconstruction results compared to vanilla DIP with random input. However, obtaining the reference input image often requires supervision and hence is difficult in practice. In this work, we propose a self-guided reconstruction scheme that uses no training data other than the set of undersampled measurements to simultaneously estimate the network weights and input (reference). We introduce a new regularization that aids the joint estimation by requiring the CNN to act as a powerful denoiser. The proposed self-guided method gives significantly improved image reconstructions for MRI with limited measurements compared to the conventional DIP and the reference-guided method, while eliminating the need for any additional data.

<p>Compressed sensing (CS) in MRI accelerates data collection by undersampling in k-space and leveraging sparsity for precise reconstructions. Recent deep learning techniques excel in MRI reconstruction from such data, though many depend on intricate models. Newer deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods offer quality image restoration by learning a policy for image refinement. However, DRL has limitations due to its limited action range and often neglects critical physics-based models seen in CS-MRI. Addressing this, we introduce an enhanced DRL framework that integrates model priors, improving DRL performance without extra computational burden. Tests show our approach outperforms previous standards.</p>

<p>Although deep learning (DL) has gained much popularity for accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), recent studies have shown that DL-based MRI reconstruction models could be over-sensitive to  tiny input perturbations (that are called `adversarial perturbations'), which cause unstable, low-quality reconstructed images. 
    This raises the question of how to design robust DL methods for  MRI reconstruction. 
    To address this problem, we propose  a novel image reconstruction framework, termed Smoothed  Unrolling (SMUG), which advances a deep unrolling-based MRI reconstruction model using a randomized smoothing (RS)-based robust learning operation. RS, which improves the tolerance of a model against input noises, has been widely used in the design of adversarial defense for image classification. Yet, we find that  the conventional design that applies RS to  the entire DL process is ineffective for  MRI reconstruction. We show that SMUG addresses the above issue by customizing the RS operation based on the unrolling  architecture  of the DL-based MRI reconstruction model. Compared to   the vanilla RS approach and several variants of SMUG,  we show that 
    SMUG improves the robustness of MRI reconstruction with respect to a diverse set of  perturbation sources, including perturbations to input measurements, different measurement sampling rates, and different unrolling steps.

<p>Traditional model-based image reconstruction
    (MBIR) methods combine forward and noise models with simple
    object priors. In this
        work, we propose a hybrid supervised-unsupervised (SUPER) learning
        framework for X-ray computed tomography (CT) image
        reconstruction. The proposed learning formulation leverages
        both sparsity or unsupervised learning-based priors and neural
        network reconstructors to simulate a fixed-point iteration
        process. Each proposed trained block consists of a deterministic
        MBIR solver and a neural network. The information flows in
        parallel through these two reconstructors and is then optimally
        combined, and multiple such blocks are cascaded to form a
        reconstruction pipeline. </p>

        <p>We demonstrate the efficacy of this
        learned hybrid model for low-dose CT image reconstruction
        with limited training data, where we use the NIH AAPM Mayo
        Clinic Low Dose CT Grand Challenge dataset for training and
        testing. In our experiments, we study combinations of supervised
        deep network reconstructors and sparse representations-based
        (unsupervised) learned or analytical priors. Our results
        demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed
        framework compared to recent reconstruction methods.</p>

<p>Measuring astrophysically relevant nuclear reaction rates can provide crucial insight into astrophysical phenomena, such as inferring neutron star properties. To measure these reaction rates we use Time Projection Chambers (TPCs). TPCs are particle detectors that perform 3D track reconstructions of particle trajectories. Recently, machine learning algorithms for image classification have emerged as valuable tools for classifying particles from their TPC track reconstructions. This is typically achieved by feeding a 2D projection of the 3D track into a 2D convolutional neural network (ConvNet). However, situations can arise where distinguishing certain particle types requires the entire 3D topology of an event. This would ordinarily require a 3D ConvNet, which is very computationally expensive, and thus not feasible given the amount of data regularly produced from a TPC. We have devised an alternate method for particle identification in these instances. By exploiting the different data modalities captured by the TPC, one can condense all of the relevant data from a 3D track into a 2D image with distinct features for a 2D ConvNet. Additionally, researchers have found that using simulated data to fine-tune an existing 2D ConvNet can allow one to identify real TPC tracks. We have discovered that by applying the methods of robustification on such fine-tuned models classification results can be greatly improved. </p>
