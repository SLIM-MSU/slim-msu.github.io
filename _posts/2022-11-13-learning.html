<p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for the detection and diagnosis of diseases. MRI scanners sequentially collect measurements in the frequency domain (or k-space), from which an image is reconstructed. A central challenge in MRI is its time-consuming sequential acquisition process as the scanner needs to densely sample the underlying k-space for accurate reconstruction. In order to improve patientsâ€™ comfort & safety and alleviate motion artifacts, reconstructing high-quality images from limited measurements is desirable. There are two core parts in the accelerated MRI pipeline: a sampling pattern deployed to collect the undersampled data in k-space and a corresponding reconstruction method (reconstructor) that also enables recovering any missing information. In this work, we use machine-learned models to predict the undersampling pattern and perform image reconstruction in a single pass and in an object-adaptive manner.</p>
